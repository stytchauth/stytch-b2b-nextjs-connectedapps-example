=======

## Getting Started

* Clone the repository to your local machine.
* Copy `.env.local.template` to `.env.local` and adjust it to fit values from your own Stytch account.
* Run the development server with `npm run dev` (or similar if using a different tool from NPM)

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the landing page.

## Learn more

The descriptions on each page are intended to give you guidance for how to proceed with this app. Keep in mind that the point of this app is not only to demonstrate what a user experiences when working with this flow, but also to provide guidance in code for how to implement this flow yourself - please do look at the source files!

When it comes to setting up Connected Apps in Stytch, please review our [getting started guide](https://stytch.com/docs/b2b/guides/connected-apps/getting-started) for more information about their configuration!

## Contributing

This app is intended to provide a reference for other developers, and is in a early / beta release state. Please do not hesitate to [file an issue](https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-b2b-nextjs-connectedapps-example/issues) or [create a pull request](https://github.com/stytchauth/stytch-b2b-nextjs-connectedapps-example/pulls) with improvements!

We're especially interested in:
* Superficial changes: typos, the copy could be clearer, etc...
* Structural changes: if it makes sense to you to e.g. break out a page into more sub-components, we'd love to hear it!
* Usability changes: it's admittedly quite open for enhancements to how the app feels to use
* Bugs: of course. If it doesn't seem to do what it should do, let us know!
